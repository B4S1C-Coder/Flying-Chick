# Flying Chick
This is a basic Flappy Bird clone made with Unity 6, for the purposes of learning Unity. The game includes a Starting screen, Game Over screen and a Score counter. It also includes basic animations.

>**Note**: This was made following this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/XtQMytORBmM?si=7wjfXc-cknhHn3D9). However, the animation, start screen and the quit functionality has been added by me which was not covered in the tutorial.

# Setup
1. Download the zip file of this Repository.
2. You can then add this project to your Unity Hub via adding projects from disk.
3. This has been built and tested on Windows 11, however there aren't any platform specific functionalities so it should work well on other platforms too.
